## 🔍 Security Considerations

### Data Privacy

#### Local Storage Only
- **No Server Communication**: The application does not send data to external servers
- **Browser Storage**: All data is stored locally in the user's browser
- **User Control**: Users have complete control over their data

#### Data Handling
- **Input Validation**: All user input is validated before processing
- **Email Validation**: Email addresses are validated using regex patterns
- **CSV Parsing**: Safe parsing with proper escaping of special characters

### Browser Security

#### HTTPS Requirements
- **Secure Context**: Clipboard API requires HTTPS
- **GitHub Pages**: Automatically provides HTTPS
- **Local Development**: Use HTTPS for testing secure features

#### Content Security
- **No External Scripts**: Application uses no external JavaScript libraries
- **No Inline Scripts**: All JavaScript is contained within the HTML file
- **No External Resources**: No external CSS or image resources

### Input Validation

#### Email Validation
```javascript
function isValidEmail(email) {
    const emailRegex = /^[^\s@]+@[^\s@]+\.[^\s@]+$/;
    return emailRegex.test(email);
}
```

#### CSV Parsing
- **Safe Parsing**: Uses proper regex for CSV parsing
- **Quote Handling**: Properly handles quoted values
- **Size Limits**: Implements reasonable file size limits

#### XSS Prevention
- **No innerHTML**: User content is never inserted via innerHTML
- **Text Content**: All user content is inserted as text content
- **Template Escaping**: Template placeholders are safely replaced

## 🔐 Security Features
